    <center><b>Press and hold S to block and reduce incoming damage</b></center>
    <center><b>Press J/K to body blow</b></center>
    <center><b>Press U/I to uppercut</b></center>
    <center><b>You win when your opponent doesn't get up after 10 seconds or is knocked down 3 times.</b></center>
    <center><b>You lose if either of these happen to you.</b></center>
    <center><b>Press punch buttons(J/K/U/I) repeatedly to get up after being knocked down</b></center>
    <center><b>Bulk has a 75% chance to block any attacks when in a neutral state. He gets in a neutral state when the player is hit by one of his attacks, or naturally a little bit after an attack.</b></center>
    <center><b>Bulk is invincible during all attacks. Unlike regular Punch Out, there is no interrupting his attacks.</b></center>
    <center><b>Bulk is vulnerable when his attacks are blocked or dodged.</b></center>
    <center><b>Don't dodge into his punches! His jumping attack cannot be blocked.</b></center>
    <center><b>Also unlike normal Punch Out, there is no gameplay difference between body blows and uppercuts other than appearance.</b></center>
